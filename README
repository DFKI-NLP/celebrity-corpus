General information:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains the corpus "Celebrity", a corpus annotated with relation
mentions for the evaluation of relation extraction (RE) experiments. Three
semantic relations have been annotated, each of them dealing with people's
family relationships (marriages, brother/sister, parent/child). The corpus
consists of more than one hundred articles from the online edition of the PEOPLE
magazine. The annotation is provided in two formats, one following a
column-oriented CoNLL-like style, and one being XML-based.

================================================================================
Corpus & annotation process:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following relations were annotated:

> marriage: relates spouses, optionally including information about the date of
            marriage, the date of divorce, and the location of the marriage
            ceremony. Maps to Freebase: /people/marriage.

-----------------------------------------------------------
argument   required   values   Freebase equivalent
-----------------------------------------------------------
person        yes       =2     /people/marriage/spouse
from          no       <=1     /people/marriage/from
to            no       <=1     /people/marriage/to
ceremony      no       <=1     /people/marriage/ceremony
-----------------------------------------------------------

> person_parent: relates parents to their children. Maps to Freebase:
                 /people/person/parents.

-----------------------------------------------------------
argument   required   values   Freebase equivalent
-----------------------------------------------------------
person       yes       >=1      /people/person
parent       yes     1<=x<=2    /people/person/parents
-----------------------------------------------------------

> sibling_relationship: relates siblings. Maps to Freebase:
                        /people/sibling_relationship.

-----------------------------------------------------------
argument   required   values   Freebase equivalent
-----------------------------------------------------------
person        yes      >=2    /people/sibling_relationship
-----------------------------------------------------------

The annotation of this corpus is restricted to instances of relations which are
mentioned within a sentence. Relation mentions whose arguments cross sentence
boundaries were treated as independent relation mentions. In order for a
relation mention to be annotated, all of the required arguments of the relation
definition must be mentioned. Consider the following snippet which does not
contain any relation mention that corresponds to this guideline: Mark married in
2000. The bride Joanne looked beautiful that day.

Entity mentions considered as argument candidates are limited to: proper nouns,
proper names, personal pronouns, possessive pronouns. Hence, the following text
piece does not constitute a relation mention, as it does not contain a valid
reference to the husband: Her husband went home.

Often sentences contain several references to a certain entity. The annotators
were instructed to choose the one entity reference which is closest and most
relevant to the relation mention.

The following table lists some statistics of the corpus and the annotation:

-------------------------------------------
# Documents                           142
-------------------------------------------
# Sentences                         25065
-------------------------------------------
# Sentences w/ relation mentions      967
-------------------------------------------
# Relation mentions
(total)                              1220
(marriage)                            421
(person_parent)                       550
(sibling_relationship)                249
-------------------------------------------

The corpus has been annotated by two independent annotators, conflicts were
decided by a third annotator. The inter-annotator agreement on the
relation-mention level is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              marriage   person_parent   sibling_relationship   micro-average
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agr(A1||A2)    0.8792       0.7258             0.7686              0.7876

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

agr(A||B): proportion of A's annotations that were also marked by B

The inter-annotator agreement on the sentence level is:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

positive/negative agreement: probability, given that one rater makes a positive/
                             negative rating, the other rater will also do so
                             (non-directional)

Cohen’s kappa: overall agreement with correction for agreement by chance

Pearson's correlation coefficient: measure of the strength of linear dependence
                                   between two variables

CoNLL-like format:

Files are UTF-8 encoded. Each file corresponds to a news article. Sentences have
been automatically split and segmented. Sentences are separated by blank lines,
each token appears on its own line. Further columns, separated by a tab
character, represent annotated relation mentions, one relation mention per
column. The format is as follows:

(RELATION:ARGUMENT*) : token is a relation argument
(RELATION:ARGUMENT*  : token is the beginning of a relation argument
*)                   : token is the end of a relation argument
*                    : depending on the prior tokens, this token is/is not part
                       of a relation mention

XML format:

Files are UTF-8 encoded. Each file corresponds to a news article. The document
text is neither sentence-wise nor token-wise segmented. Relation mentions are
listed at the end of the files, after the text of the article.
