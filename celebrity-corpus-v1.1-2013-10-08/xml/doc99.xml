<TEXT>Paul McCartney led a chorus of "Happy Birthday." Bo Derek, his costar in the 1979 comedy hit 10, told him, "If not for you, Dudley, I would have been a zero." But it was a bit of British blue humor that summoned the biggest reaction from Dudley Moore as he watched stiffly in Carnegie Hall—barely able to stand or even control his facial movements—during a charity gala to mark his 66th birthday last April. "We had 'wanker,' which was one of his favorite words, spelled out by dancers with their arms and canes," says 10 producer Tony Adams, who organized the tribute. "He got it and had a huge grin on his face."

During the following months, as a rare Parkinson's-like illness sapped his abilities to walk, speak and play his beloved piano, the impish comedian known to his fellow Brits as Cuddly Dudley clung to his sense of humor. Never did he need it more than during his last weeks: In late March Moore contracted pneumonia as a complication of the disease—a degenerative brain disorder called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)—and took a turn for the worse. Too ill to attend the March 16 wedding of his Arthur costar Liza Minnelli, he spent his final days watching movies and listening to Mozart, Chopin and his favorite jazz recordings at his three-bedroom home in Plainfield, N.J., next door to his close friend and caregiver, concert pianist Rena Fruchter. A CD of Moore's own piano compositions, Songs Without Words, was playing when he finally succumbed to the illness in bed at home, surrounded by Fruchter and her family. "We were holding his hands, one of my daughters and I and my husband and the nurse," says Fruchter, 54. "He was conscious until just before the end." On April 2 about 70 friends—including <NODE id="1729" />his<NODE id="1732" /> ex-wives <NODE id="1742" />Tuesday Weld<NODE id="1754" /> and <NODE id="1759" />Brogan Lane<NODE id="1770" />—gathered for a memorial service at a funeral home in Watchung, N.J. "It was very private, very moving, with some irreverence," says Adams. "It wasn't about glitz or glamor but Dudley the person."

It was a peaceful departure for an entertainer who was as tormented as he was talented. An Oxford-educated pianist, Moore touched extraordinary high notes in his career as a comedian, from his groundbreaking '60s satire as a member of London's Beyond the Fringe comedy troupe to his Oscar-nominated performance as a pickled playboy in 1981's Arthur. But he experienced the other end of the scale as well, with a notoriously discordant love life—his four marriages to statuesque women who towered over his 5'2" frame all ended in divorce—and struggles with depression he traced to childhood traumas. "He loved to be loved," says Blake Edwards, his 10 director, "because he felt so unloved."

Moore began experiencing early symptoms of his illness in the mid-'90s. His unsteadiness and slurred speech led to rumors he had become a real-life version of the sozzled Arthur. But Moore wasn't a heavy drinker. "He was falling backwards and not having energy and not feeling right," says Fruchter. "He thought it was stress or depression." When he couldn't remember his lines for a role in the 1996 movie The Mirror Has Two Faces, director Barbra Streisand was forced to fire him—a step he found deeply humiliating. In 1997 he had surgery to repair a tiny hole in his heart, but the problems worsened. Doctors were mystified by his condition. <NODE id="3304" />His<NODE id="3307" /> third wife, model-turned-landscape-designer <NODE id="3352" />Brogan Lane<NODE id="3363" />, 42, remembers accompanying her ex-husband to a neurosurgeon. She told the doctor that Moore had just returned from a trip to London. "I haven't been to London," Moore said. " 'You were there for three months,' " Lane says she replied. "He just looked back at me sadly with his big brown eyes as if to say, 'What's happened to me?' "

In 1998 he found out. New Jersey neuro-ophthalmologist Martin Gizzi diagnosed him with PSP, which attacks the portions of the brain that control balance and speech and has no cure. Devastated, Moore nevertheless displayed typical dark humor in 1999 when he announced he had the condition, which strikes only 1 in 100,000: "It is in some way considerate of me that I have taken on the disease for myself," he cracked, "thus protecting the remaining 99,999 Screen Actors Guild members from this fate."

By then he was living with Fruchter and <NODE id="4240" />her<NODE id="4243" /> husband, <NODE id="4253" />Brian Dallow<NODE id="4265" />, 58, who had become close friends with Moore in the early '90s, when Moore joined the board of Music for All Seasons, a charity Fruchter and Dallow had founded to bring live music to hospitals. "He was scared and depressed," explains Fruchter. "He needed things to be calm and a family situation." Over the next three years he underwent speech and physical therapy at two New Jersey hospitals and by late 2000 had purchased the house next to Fruchter's and hired a full-time nurse. Even when he knew he was losing the fight, "there was always laughter," says Fruchter. "We laughed at the piano, even recently when he would try playing and we would laugh at how difficult things had become."

Moore had always been able to turn his troubles into comedy. His odds-defying climb to stardom began in London's Charing Cross Hospital, where <NODE id="5101" />he<NODE id="5103" /> was born in 1935 to <NODE id="5124" />Ada<NODE id="5127" />, a shorthand typist, and <NODE id="5153" />John<NODE id="5157" />, a railroad worker. Ada found her infant son's clubfoot and deformed leg "shameful" and later told him she had wanted to kill him at birth, Moore told biographer Barbra Paskin. <NODE id="5335" />Moore<NODE id="5340" /> never got over his mother's chilliness, says ex-wife <NODE id="5394" />Lane<NODE id="5398" />, who remained friendly with him. "He always reflected on the past as if it was present," she says. "His mother was his biggest issue. He unconsciously punished other females. It was like getting back at her."

Growing up in a working-class housing project outside London, Moore spent most of his early childhood "either in the hospital, being operated on, or at home, sitting in splints, recovering," he told Playboy in 1983. Although the operations succeeded in straightening his leg and foot, Moore still walked with a limp, and his diminutive stature didn't help in the schoolyard. "Kids used to shout, 'Hopalong!' and mimic me," he told Playboy. "I got funny so I wouldn't get beaten up anymore."

Along with a penchant for cutting humor, Moore developed a passion for music. His talent on the piano and organ won him a scholarship to a private music high school, then to Oxford University. Initially he felt out of place among his upper-class peers, but he blossomed as he explored the world beyond his classical studies. He jammed in jazz clubs, composed cabaret numbers for student revues and clowned at parties by playing pop songs in the style of Bach. After graduating in 1958, Moore nixed an offer to become organist at King's College to try his luck as a jazzman, cutting his first single, "Strictly for the Birds," for future Beatles producer George Martin.

He found a faster track to fame when he joined up with fellow Oxford grad Alan Bennett and Cambridge cutups Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller to create the comedy revue Beyond the Fringe. The show became a rafter-rattling hit on London's West End in 1961 and moved to Broadway the following year. With sketches that poked fun at previously taboo topics like religion and royalty, the show helped pioneer a revolution in British humor and inspired admirers such as the Monty Python troupe.

When the foursome disbanded in 1964, Moore and Cook formed a partnership that would last, on and off, for more than a decade. They continued their sketch-comedy success with the BBC TV series Not Only ... But Also, acted with their idol Peter Sellers in The Wrong Box and wrote and starred in the 1967 movie farce Bedazzled (remade in 2000 starring Brendan Fraser). Moore wore three pairs of underwear for his steamy scene with Raquel Welch. "I thought it was going to be very embarrassing, but ultimately it turned out to be unerotic," he told Paskin.

Moore starred in other British films—none hits—before reteaming with Cook for another Fringe-like theatrical revue, Good Evening, which ran in London and New York from 1972 to 1974. The pair also released three ultra-raunchy "Derek and Give" comedy albums and a movie spinoff that prompted a censorship battle in Britain. But Moore and Cook split on bitter terms when Moore, buoyed by dazzling reviews for his supporting turn with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn in 1978's Foul Play, left to pursue Hollywood success.

Cook had reason to be miffed: Moore's career was about to soar. The film 10, in which he starred as a middle-aged composer who falls for dream girl Bo Derek, launched them both to fame. "He was still virtually unknown in this country, and I was completely unknown, so we went through a life-changing experience," says Derek, 45, who has said that the notorious ladies' man was "very sweet with me—shy, believe it or not." Two years later Arthur was a box office smash. Basing his performance in part on the hard-drinking Cook, who died of liver failure at age 57 in 1995, Moore made the spoiled, childish millionaire "a satyr, a sprite, an overage waif and a consistently endearing showoff," wrote The New York Times. "His timing is impeccable."

He also became the most unlikely of sex symbols, and began dating 5'11" actress Susan Anton. ("People say never the twain shall meet, but we do," he joked.) Arthur costar Jill Eikenberry understood the appeal of the man PEOPLE dubbed a Sex Thimble: "He was a flirt," she says. "He was very sexy and he really knew how to turn his light on you. You just got his full attention. He made you feel very special and very beautiful and extraordinary." Moore "brought out a nurturing quality in women," adds Anton, 51. "I know he did in me."

But Moore's serious relationships had a habit of fizzling. In <NODE id="9672" />1968<NODE id="9676" /> <NODE id="9677" />he<NODE id="9679" /> had married actress <NODE id="9700" />Suzy Kendall<NODE id="9712" />. They split in 1972 after Moore balked at having children but remained close until his death. "Through thick and thin, she stuck with him as a friend," says Moore's longtime pal, jazz vocalist Cleo Laine, 74. "She was probably the one he should have stayed with."

Soon after his divorce he teamed with '60s sex kitten Tuesday Weld, with whom he'd had an earlier fling. When Weld got pregnant in 1975, Moore asked her to marry him—but shortly after son Patrick's birth the shaky union fell apart. <NODE id="10210" />He<NODE id="10212" /> and <NODE id="10217" />Weld<NODE id="10221" /> divorced in <NODE id="10234" />1979<NODE id="10238" />; Patrick, a sometime gas-station attendant in L.A., attended Moore's memorial service; he and his father had not spoken for more than a year. Moore had insisted he didn't want Patrick to see his condition. "People tried to tell him it wasn't the best way to deal with it, that it would have been better if they spoke," says Fruchter. "It was a complicated relationship."

In <NODE id="10614" />1988<NODE id="10618" /> <NODE id="10619" />Moore<NODE id="10624" /> wed <NODE id="10629" />Brogan Lane<NODE id="10640" />, then 29, but the two separated after 16 months. "I used to think all men were my father, and he thought all women were his mother, so we probably didn't have a very adult relationship going on," Lane said later. <NODE id="10854" />His<NODE id="10857" /> final marriage in <NODE id="10876" />i994<NODE id="10880" />, to ex-model <NODE id="10894" />Nicole Rothschild<NODE id="10911" />, now 38, produced a son, <NODE id="10937" />Nicholas<NODE id="10945" />, in 1995, but exploded four years later, with the two trading lurid allegations of emotional and physical abuse. (A friend says Moore requested that Rothschild, who lives with Nicholas, 6, in L.A., not be invited to his funeral.)

As PSP sapped his memory and timing, Moore conceded that his acting career was over (his last appearance came in A Weekend in the Country, a 1996 TV movie) and focused on his therapy and charity work. In 2000 he released a CD of a 1992 piano concert and comedy performance to benefit Music for All Seasons and his newly created Dudley Moore Research Fund for PSP. Friends like Derek and 10 costar Julie Andrews pitched in for fund-raising events such as the 66th-birthday gala. As the audience cheered that night, friends helped Moore stand and give a wave egging on the applause. The crowd roared with laughter. "He couldn't speak, but he was giving us a laugh," says Eikenberry. "Classic Dudley—he just wanted us to have a good time."

His last public appearance had its own rewards. On Nov. 16 Prince Charles—an ardent fan—presented the comedian with a Commander of the British Empire award at Buckingham Palace for his achievements in television, film and theater. Moore, who was accompanied by Fruchter and <NODE id="12189" />his<NODE id="12192" /> sister <NODE id="12200" />Barbara Stevens<NODE id="12215" />, 72, a retired shorthand typist who lives in England, "was really moved," says Fruchter. Afterward the group joined Laine, <NODE id="12339" />Moore<NODE id="12344" />'s ex-wife <NODE id="12355" />Kendall<NODE id="12362" /> and other friends for a celebratory lunch at London's Savoy Hotel, a favorite old haunt. Though Moore was all but mute, true to form he issued a guttural giggle when <NODE id="12529" />Laine<NODE id="12534" />'s husband, jazz musician <NODE id="12560" />John Dankworth<NODE id="12574" />, told a joke about hemorrhoids. "It made everyone around the table almost weep with joy at the fact that he could still laugh inwardly," says Laine. Still, "he knew it was his last trip to England," Fruchter says. "After he said goodbye to his sister, he kept looking back."

The cruelty of his long, creeping illness made the news of Moore's death bittersweet to many who knew him. "My first response was to cry, and my second response was to feel so grateful that he's now free of this thing," says his friend Eikenberry. "I keep picturing him dancing with glee because he's finally free of this body that wasn't working for him anymore."
