<TEXT>For more than half of her 14 years, Lauren Makowski's life has revolved around her weight. When she ballooned to 100 lbs. in second grade after being put on steroids to treat her asthma, she had to sit on the sidelines during recess, unable to fit on the swings and go-carts. In class, where students called her LFG—their shorthand for Little Fat Girl—she sat on the floor for a week until a large-size desk could be found. In third grade, after a doctor prescribed Ritalin to control her fidgeting, Lauren gained another 60 lbs. Bereft after being made fun of at a classmate's birthday party, "she came home and cried for hours," <NODE id="631" />her<NODE id="634" /> mother, <NODE id="643" />Debby<NODE id="648" />, 39, recalls. And she ate. "Food was everything to me," says Lauren. "If anyone said something that made me emotional, I would cry, feel frustrated and eat."

By March 2001 Lauren's weight topped 292. At home in New Britain, Conn., she found comfort in Mrs. Fields cookies and Pringles—and bullying her family. When Debby tried to curb Lauren's snacking, Lauren would yell, "You don't love me! If you did, you'd have ice cream with me." After Lauren complained that "I don't want to be the heaviest person in the house," Debby packed 70 lbs. onto her own trim frame. When Lauren greeted Debby's subsequent attempt to lose weight with "I hate you," Debby quit her liquid diet. Lauren's response to Debby's regimen of 5 a.m. walks was to lock her mom out of the house. So Debby quit her walks. <NODE id="1441" />Lauren<NODE id="1447" />'s 5'7", 108-lb. sister <NODE id="1471" />Alexis<NODE id="1477" />, 20, tries to be sensitive, but mostly she keeps her distance. Lauren's weight, Alexis says, "affects everybody in the house."

Today juvenile obesity is rocking an escalating number of American households. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in October, 15 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 19 are overweight or obese (double the number of 20 years ago); so are 10 percent of 2-to 5-year-olds. With that surge has come a raft of related health problems. Gallbladder disease among children has tripled; sleep-related breathing disruptions have quintupled; and type 2 diabetes—with its attendant risks of blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart attack, stroke, even death—has doubled, afflicting an estimated 300,000 American youngsters. Warns Dr. Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy in Davis: "We are sitting on a time bomb."

America's 5.3 million overweight kids plainly need a battle (of the bulge) plan. But this is a tricky war, with multiple fronts. A recent Surgeon General's report notes that while genetics can play a part, two other factors are equally significant: too much food and too little exercise. "We're up against something big," says CDC childhood-obesity expert Dr. William Dietz. "It's the way we're living." A wired wonderland of TV shows and video games, for instance, keeps 43 percent of adolescents glued to the tube more than two hours a day; better than a quarter of 8-to-16-year-olds watch twice that. Meanwhile, less than two-thirds of high school kids get more than an hour of exercise a week.

Even America's youngest are turning into couch-tater tykes. "Kids become containerized and don't spend as much time moving around as they should," says Jane Clark, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Maryland, College Park. Motor skills don't develop and, says Clark, "if you aren't skilled you're not likely to engage in activities." Instead, kids sit in front of the TV being bombarded with messages for sugary, high-fat foods with little nutritional value.

One vulnerable target is Alysia Lopez who, at 5, already weighs 90 lbs. Just 3'6" tall, she wears size-16 clothes from the teen department. In restaurants Alysia orders adult-size meals. When <NODE id="3776" />her<NODE id="3779" /> mother, <NODE id="3788" />Mychelle Estrada<NODE id="3804" />, 43, tried to order a child's plate on a recent outing in their hometown of Sacramento, Alysia screamed, "I don't want that!" Instead she downed a New York steak, hash browns and two eggs over easy. Weight problems run in Alysia's family: Mychelle and one of Alysia's three half siblings are overweight; <NODE id="4109" />her<NODE id="4112" /> father, <NODE id="4121" />Steve Lopez<NODE id="4132" />, 41, is stout. "I was raised on tortillas, beans, eggs, papas," says Mychelle, an office assistant with the state Department of Motor Vehicles. "I don't have control of my own eating. How am I supposed to teach my daughter?"

Mychelle has sought the help of Dr. Nancy Schonfeld-Warden, a children's-weight-management expert at the University of California, Davis. She calls Alysia's seeming insatiability "food-seeking behavior" and says it may result from a gene mutation that blocks the brain from signaling when the body has been fed enough. With Alysia, she also suspects emotional factors such as boredom or stress. Whatever the cause, the remedy is the same: Move around more, eat wisely and eat less. "We need to start thinking 'What does she need to be nourished?' not 'What does she want?' " says Schonfeld-Warden. Mychelle has considered enrolling <NODE id="4991" />Alysia<NODE id="4997" /> in Weight Watchers, but dad <NODE id="5026" />Steve<NODE id="5031" />, a cement finisher, is resistant. "My daughter's going to grow out of it, because I leave it up to the Lord," he says.

Meanwhile Alysia's health is deteriorating. Brief walks leave her short of breath. Her cholesterol is over 200, more than 30 points above the norm. Her heft exacerbates a bone problem in her left leg that limits exercise and causes a limp. She runs a high risk of developing diabetes, a disease shared by her mother and three grandparents. "It's not just Alysia who has to go on a program," says Schonfeld-Warden. "The whole family has to develop healthier lifestyles. You can't manage a child's weight in a vacuum."

For the Wymers of St. Clair, Mo., a family-centric approach made the difference for Matthew, 17, who tipped the scale at 346 lbs. in August 2001. "He was just miserable," says <NODE id="5846" />his<NODE id="5849" /> father, <NODE id="5858" />Vernon<NODE id="5864" />, 53. "He was slowly killing himself—and we were letting it happen." Before the family joined forces, <NODE id="5966" />Vernon<NODE id="5972" />, a design engineer, and wife <NODE id="6002" />Cathy<NODE id="6007" />, 50, a real estate agent, were overweight too. Long work hours gave them little inclination to exercise and an excuse to grab fast-food dinners. "It was easier to bring in food than to cook a lot of healthy stuff," Cathy says.

Matt found comfort in junk food. "I hated myself for being out of control," he says. "I wanted to die." Finally, his physician Dr. Martin Rudloff warned him that he would die, and soon, if he didn't change his habits. "He talked to me like a mature person," Matt says. "He made me feel there was something I could do." It took six months for Rudloff to convince the Wymers' insurance carrier to cover the costs of Committed to Kids, a nationwide multidisciplinary weight-loss plan. The cost: $2,750 for a yearlong program. "We try to change the dynamic of the family," says Dr. John Galgani, the program's medical director. Since last summer Matt has shed 139 lbs. Cathy, who has gone with him to each of his weekly two-hour sessions, has lost 90 lbs.; Vernon has lost 10. The Wymers learned to eat in moderation, make healthy food choices and be more active. Now 207 lbs., Matt jogs, lifts weights and has taken a swing-dancing class with Cathy.

Holding parents solely responsible for their children's eating habits, however, is being "blind to what goes on in our culture," cautions health advocate Goldstein. He points to what he calls "an unholy partnership" between schools and fast-food chains. According to Eric Schlosser, author of last year's Fast Food Nation, some 30 percent of public high school cafeterias sell food from companies like Taco Bell, McDonald's, Pizza Hut and Domino's Pizza. "Schools get a cut of sales and use that profit to buy books, band stuff or athletic equipment," he says.

Since public school food must adhere to U.S. Department of Agriculture nutritional guidelines, many fast-food items served to students have been altered to reduce fat content. Those guidelines, however, do not apply to school vending machines. "I buy a lot of Twix bars and Skittles," says Bianca Lewis, 13, who is 5'7" and weighs 236 lbs. "Those are my favorites. And soda." After being diagnosed last year with type 2 diabetes—a form of the disease that, until recently, primarily afflicted people over 50—Bianca began thrice-daily insulin shots. Otherwise, the Gainesville, Fla., seventh grader has made few lifestyle changes. She still snacks on cookies and spends hours each day playing computer games. Her guardian and grandfather, Willie Lewis, 67, says it is hard to find the fresh produce recommended by a dietician. He doesn't worry that the treadmill he bought Bianca stands idle. "Her blood sugar is within range," he says. "I think she'll outgrow the diabetes."

Even now the parents of Xenia Rhodes have a hard time believing excess weight killed their daughter. In February 2001, Xenia, 11, who carried 291 lbs. on her 5'6" frame, lay down on her sixth-grade-classroom floor in Fairburn, Ga., and never got up. An autopsy determined that she died from cardiomegaly, an enlarged heart. "Morbid obesity is defined as 100 lbs. over ideal body weight," wrote medical examiner Dr. Allan Bennett, "and is considered to be a contributing factor in her death." The girl's mother, LaShun Pace, 41, herself overweight, didn't want to add to Xenia's social distress by pushing a diet. "At 11, you shouldn't be under pressure," she says. "If you're a little chubby, you got to give it time."

But a steady diet of fast food can help harden childhood pudginess into adolescent fat. At McDonald's, today's Super Size servings are three times the size of 1970 portions. An order of fries is 610 calories; a 44-oz. soda is 410. (For 11-year-olds the recommended total daily allowance is 2,200 calories for a girl, 2,500 for a boy.) Add a Big Mac (590 calories), says Margo Wootan, nutrition-policy director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C., and "it would take two hours of running to burn off that meal."

Chances are that won't happen during school hours. Fewer than one in 10 schools offer daily phys ed classes; among the states, only Illinois makes daily phys ed mandatory. Yet those classes can make a difference. Joshua Griffin, 9, of Fairborn, Ohio, who weighs 173 lbs., credits gym teacher Mark Shillito with teaching him about healthy eating and building his confidence to try out for peewee football.

Ryan Campbell, 15, of Coconut Creek, Fla., who dreams of snowboarding, has gone the surgical route. Already heavy, Ryan shot up to 452 lbs. after his grandfather died in 2000. "All I did was eat," he says. "That was how I dealt with the loss." Efforts to reduce—diets, personal trainers, nutritionists, hypnotists—only produced $20,000 in bills. So in July Ryan underwent Roux-en-Y gastric-bypass surgery, which restricts food intake by reducing the stomach to a thumb-size pouch. Most candidates for the surgery are between 18 and 55, but Ryan's surgeon, Dr. Robert Marema of Fort Lauderdale, argues that for 5'8" Ryan, the surgery "prevented potentially life-threatening diseases, increased mobility and restored self-esteem." It also cost $35,000, which Ryan's insurance has covered. Anticipating a 160-lb. version of himself, Ryan, who has already dropped 115 lbs., says with a smile, "I'm gonna be a babe magnet."

Lauren Makowski also enjoys a new vision of herself. Two summers ago her parents overrode her protestations and packed her off to Camp Kingsmont, a retreat for overweight kids in West Stockbridge, Mass., where she learned about nutrition, exercise and self-esteem from the camp's 90 counselors, most of whom were once obese. She also lost 30 lbs. "Camp changed the way I look at food and portion control," she says. Back at Kingsmont this summer, the 5'6" teen shed 37 more pounds and now weighs in at 235. Newly confident, Lauren now dresses in peasant blouses "like Britney Spears wears," she says, and lace-up jeans. "I feel much better about myself," says Lauren. "I feel happy."
