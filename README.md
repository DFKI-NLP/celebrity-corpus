# Celebrity Corpus
The “Celebrity” corpus consists of 150 news articles annotated with three semantic relations of the biographic domain. The corpus is provided in two formats, a CoNLL-like format (plain-text files with tabular-separated values) and an XML-based format. Files in the XML-based format can be loaded with the <a href="https://github.com/DFKI-NLP/recon">Recon tool</a>.
